# Brain Stroke Prediction Project

Welcome to the Brain Stroke Prediction Project! This project was completed as part of our fifth semester research and mini-project in collaboration with Devansh Badoni.

## Project Overview

The Brain Stroke Prediction Project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the risk of brain strokes in patients based on various factors such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle choices. Our goal is to provide a tool that can help medical professionals in assessing the risk of stroke in patients.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-stroke-prediction-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd brain-stroke-prediction-project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Models Used

We used several machine learning models for brain stroke prediction, including:
- **Model 1**: Describe the model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and its performance.
- **Model 2**: Describe the model and its performance.
- **Model 3**: Describe the model and its performance.

## Results

Our models achieved the following results:
- Describe the accuracy and performance of your models, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Include any charts or graphs that illustrate your findings.

## Future Work

- Suggestions for improvements and areas for further research.
- Potential new data sources or models to explore.
